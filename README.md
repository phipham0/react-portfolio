# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is a webpage that is displaying my personal portfolio. It contains a header with a navigation bar that links to three main sections: About Me, Work, and Contact Me.
The work section acts as a flex box that wraps to display the cards in a readable manner. Note that the first work card is the biggest and takes up the width of the screen. At 
the bottom of the page are links to my personal information. These items also adapt to the size of the view port.

This project was both a challenging yet fun test of my CSS capabilities. It was not only a homework assignment, but it was also practice for making my own portfolio in the future. 
I think the fact that is was a project for myself made me more motivated to and allowed me to expand my knowledge by googling are sorts of methods and properties I can give my elements.
The portfolio is a good head start on my programming abilities and builds a foundation of my first webpage. I've learned heaps building this website, and I think I can only gain more wisdom.
Working with flexbox was definitely my most challenging issue, but once I got the hang of it, it made sense. After creating this project, I feel like I can think more as a web developer and in 
the context of each element and how they interact with each other.

## Usage

There are three interactive links in the Navigation Bar in the upper right corner. Each link, About Me, My Work, and Contact Me,
will send the user down the webpage to more information. Also, in the work section, there are two clickable cards/links that will send you to that appropriate project.
At the end of the page, there are links for my personal information. For the rest of the page, the text can be read and the webpage can be scrolled through.
