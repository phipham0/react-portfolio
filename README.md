# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is my portfolio that displays my information, past projects, a way to contact me, and my resume for the world to see. This project was mostly a display of my react skills. Although, I feel I need to come back to this project and add more to it. For now, this will stay up as my portfolio, but in the future I want to see how much I've progressed.

## Installation
